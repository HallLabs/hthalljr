"Very Cold Fusion" project.
- Hello, I'm @hthalljr, Howard Tracy Hall, Jr. I go by Tracy, or by Tracy Jr when I'm around my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- At age 76, I'm coming out of retirement to lead an open-source project at Hall Labs which we call "Very Cold Fusion."
- "Very Cold Fusion" is free, to all, to contribute to or to use. No secrecy. No IP. We will publish ideas, experiments, successes & failures in real time on the Internet.
- We encourage every fork of this project to also remain open source and free to all.
- Hall Labs is an incubator founded by my brother, David R. Hall. Many of our projects are directed at commercial opportunities, but fusion is too big for anyone to own.
- Through his foundation, David is funding the project, and I'm donating my time (I already have a good retirement income.)
- After a review of the large literature published in the 33 years since the announcement by Fleischmann and Pons on March 23, 1989, I have a vague notion that the phenomenon of "anomalous heat" / aka "cold fusion" / aka "low energy nuclear reactions" is associated with isolated tiny pockets of superconductivity.
- If this notion is correct, it means that man has been observing high temperature superconductivity -- as high as several hundred C -- for 33 years!
- So our first efforts will focus on finding a material that can be highy loaded with deuterium and which is also is either a bulk superconductor or at least has an adequately continuous network of superconducting centers.
- That will probably only happen at very low temperatures, hence "Very Cold Fusion."
- To date the "anomalous heat" observed in cold fusion appears to arise from coupling of some distributed state of deuterium to the ground state of helium-4 via "baby steps" coupled to phonons in the lattice that gently lower the deuterium to the helium ground state. This results in release of the energy of fusion via excitation of optical phonons at teraherz frequencies -- as heat.
- We will then form a resonant microwave cavity out of the new material, cool it down to an appropriate temperature, wave a magic wand, and then very gently lower the distributed deuterium state via baby-baby steps to the ground state of helium 4, extracting the fusion energy as gigaherz microwaves -- as electrity!
