"Very Cold Fusion" project.
- Hello, I'm @hthalljr, Howard Tracy Hall, Jr. I go by Tracy, or by Tracy Jr when I'm around my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- At age 76, I'm coming out of retirement to lead an open-source project at Hall Labs which we call "Very Cold Fusion."
- Every aspect of the Very Cold Fusion project is committed to the public domain. It is free, to all, to contribute to or to use. No secrecy. No IP. We will publish ideas, experiments, successes & failures in real time on the Internet.
- We encourage every fork of this project to also remain open source and free to all, but if you think your improvement is patentable and you have the resources to commercialize it, go for it! Remember, however, that at least in the USA, the patent office classifies cold fusion with perpetual motion and requires a working model. 
- Hall Labs is an incubator founded by my brother, David R. Hall. Many of our projects are directed at commercial opportunities, but fusion is too big for anyone to own.
- Through his foundation, David is funding the project, and I'm donating my time (I already have a good retirement income.)
- After a review of the large literature published in the 33 years since the announcement by Fleischmann and Pons on March 23, 1989, I have a vague notion that the phenomenon of "anomalous heat" / aka "cold fusion" / aka "low energy nuclear reactions" is associated with isolated tiny pockets of superconductivity.
- If this notion is correct, it means that man has been observing high temperature superconductivity -- as high as several hundred C -- for 33 years!
- That will probably only happen at very low temperatures, hence "Very Cold Fusion."
- To date all theories attempting to explain the "anomalous heat" that has been observed in thousands of cold fusion experiments seem to me to be grasping at straws: we just don't fully understand what is going on. But the style of arm-waving that appeals most to me suggests that cold fusion is a collective phenomenon. There appears to be some distributed state of deuterium that enables two deuterium atoms to fuse to the helium-4 ground state via baby steps. Each step appears to release its energy to an optical phonon in the lattice at a frequency in the terahertz range -- as heat.
- Realizing that superconductivity is also a collective phenomenon, our efforts will focus on finding a material that can be highy loaded with deuterium and is also a bulk superconductor -- or at least is able to sustain a continuous network of filamentary superconducting centers that "short circuit" the bulk material.
- We will then form a resonant microwave cavity out of the new material, cool it down to an appropriate temperature, wave a magic wand, and very gently lower the distributed deuterium state via baby-baby steps to the ground state of helium 4, extracting the fusion energy as gigahertz microwaves -- as electricity!
