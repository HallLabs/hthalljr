Project: Molten Salt Fusion
- Hello, I'm Howard Tracy Hall, Jr, @hthalljr. I go by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father and from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- in May of 2022, at the age of 76, I came out of retirement to pursue this project at Hall Labs, which I called "Very Cold Fusion." It was based on a hunch that cold fusion might be associated with superconductivity and that low temperature might enhance that effect. My intent was to extract fusion energy directly as microwaves in a resonant cavity operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures. After 7 months of study, I failed to find much of a basis for the idea and decided to focus on incremental improvements to the work of others. 
- Hall Labs is an evergreen incubator founded in 1955 by H. Tracy Hall, Sr. Its current CEO is my brother, David R. Hall, who is semi-retired. Hall Labs is funding the project and providing facilities and the support of its employees; I am donating my ideas and time.
- Our project is open-source and committed in its entirety to the public domain. Anything we discover is free to all, with no secrecy and no patents. (How can you patent fire?) We publish all our concepts, plans, and results on the Internet, regardless of success or failure. (Let's just call those first 7 months a "learning experience.") 
- GitHub is our primary repository; new commits to Github are announced on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tracy-Hall-Jr/578136106/
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts on their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your improvements to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your improvements are patentable, go for it! Do be aware that, at least in the USA, the patent office regards "cold fusion" with the same contempt as "perpetual motion," and it might insist on a working model.
- Within a year of the March 23, 1989 announcement by Martin Fleischmann & Stanley Pons, Stan Szpak & Pamela Mosier-Boss improved upon their work with a "codeposition" experiment. Szpak reasoned that the long incubation time in the F-P experiment must have been due to slow diffusion in palladium, so under conditions similar to F-P, they deposited deuterium simultaneously with palladium. The deuterium was instantly included in the palladium at high concentration, requiring little if any diffusion. Rather than waiting weeks to observe excess heat, Szpak & Mosier-Boss observed it promptly.
- In 2003, Melvin Miles reviewed many experiments that pointed to the principle nuclear ash as Helium 4, in quantities commensurate with the observed heat. Since Helium has very low diffusion in palladium, these experiments indicated that the nuclear-active site must be at or near the surface.
- Some explanations of the F-P affect identify the nuclear-active site as a vacancy phase in Pd that is stabilized by deuterium. Super-abundant vacancies (SAVs) were discovered in 1993 by Yu Fukai and coworkers, who forced hydrogen into nickel, palladium, and other metals at 5GPa (50 kbar) at 700 to 800 C. They encapsulated their sample in salt, which is an excellent pressure transmitting medium and is impervious to hydrogen. (For the same reason, much oil and gas is found under a cap of salt). Vacancy concentrations in metals, even near their melting points, are usually less than about 0.1%, but Fukai observed astonishing vacancy concentrations of up to 30%! Each vacancy was stabilized by bonding to 6 adjacent hydrogen atoms. Significant for our experiment, the vacancies persisted at atmospheric pressure up to about 800 C. Fukai's discovery upset the received understanding of metal-hydrogen systems by demonstrating that SAVs are the most thermodynamically stable phase, and that most previously-known phases are actually metastable relative to SAVs. Fukai went on to observe hydrogen-stabilized vacancancies that had persisted for decades in electrodeposited copper and nickel.
- Interestingly, Fukai employed a cubic x-ray press and calibrated his pressure with Dan Decker's semi-empirical PVT equation of state for sodium chloride. My father invented the tetrahedral press in 1958 and the cubic press shortly thereafter. Later, with Dean Barnett, he adapted the tetrahedral press for in-situ x-ray diffraction, and he and others, with input from Decker, used it to confirm Decker's scale. The elegant tetrahedral x-ray press is now on display at Hall Labs.
- In 2012, Dennis Letts & Peter Hagelstein suggested that Fleischmann and Pons had, in fact, unknowingly created conditions for formation of SAVs, and that the nuclear activity had occurred in the outer 100-300 nanometers of the palladium cathode. They provide an estimation of the H/metal ratio needed for 1% to 25% SAVs at temperatures from 0 to 1000K. For 25% SAVs in nickel, the ratio decreases from 0.7 at 0K to 0.53 at 1000K. For 25% SAVs in palladium, it decreases from 1.0 at 0K to 0.8 at 1000K. They improved the Szpak protocol by reducing the Pd(+2) concentration 40-fold while increasing D(+) activity, thereby promoting SAVs. Their experiment ran at 50C (323K), with a D/Pd ratio of about 0.95 and an estimated SAV concentration of 25%. Ours will run at about 650C (923K), with a D/Ni ratio of about 0.55 and a SAV concentration of about 25%.
- Most cold fusion experiments to date have been in aqueous systems, with temperatures below the boiling of water (100 C). Sadi Carnot's theorem (1824) states that the efficiency of any heat engine is limited to the ratio (T1-T2)/T1, where T1 is the input temperature and T2 is the output temperature, in Kelvin. Thus the efficiency of a heat engine with 100 C (373 K) input and 25 C (298 K) output is limited to (373-298)/373, or about 20%. Modern thermal power plants generate steam at about 650 C (923 K) and condense it at 25 C (298K), for a maximum efficiency of about (923-298)/923, or about 68%.
- We propose two modest improvements to existing cold fusion technology:
- First, Run hot!
- We will conduct the reaction in molten lithium chloride (LiCl) at about 650C, in the same temperature range as thermal power plants. The nickel source will be nickel oxide (NiO), which reacts with 2LiCl to produce, in solution, nickel chloride (NiCl2) and lithium oxide (Li2O). In the electrolytic reduction of spent uranium oxide fuel in molten LiCl, a small percent of Li2O, up to 1 weight %, is added to lower the reduction potential of uranium oxide and to assure that the gas produced at the anode will be oxygen instead of chlorine. (Li20 is soluble in molten LiCl to about 9 weight %.) In our experiment, the Li2O generated from NiO will have the same effect. The deuterium source will be D2O, introduced as vapor carried in argon. D2O will react with 2LiCl to form, in solution, 2DCl and more Li2O. We will probably need to engage a consultant with expertise in thermochemical and electrochemical database software to help us optimize the electrochemical activity of all species. I do believe that D(+) activity can be freely increased while Ni(2+) activity can be limited, so as to favor SAV creation. 
- Second, Run in circles!
- We propose cyclic codeposition and destruction of a very thin film of metal deuteride having SAVs. Prior protocols for codeposition of palladium with deuterium lead to the burial of these expensive materials in the growing deposit: in one extended experiment, reported by Mosier-Boss to Letts & Hagelstein, the palladium-deuterium deposit on a thin square copper cathode grew to a sphere one inch in diameter! Since the nuclear activity occurs at or near the surface, why not cyclically disintigrate and replace that surface? We hope to accomplish this using alternating current (AC) codeposition between two identical electrodes, A and B, which on successive half-cycles alternate between serving as cathode (reduction and deposition) and anode (oxidation and dissolution). In the first half-cycle, a thin layer of paladium deuteride in a nuclear-active SAV state is laid down on electrode A, while the layer that had been deposited previously on electrode B is simultaneously disintigrated. In the second half-cycle, an active layer is laid down on electrode B while the layer on electrode A is disintigrated. The dissolution products remain in solution close to their respective electrodes, to be re-deposited  in the next half-cycle. Cathode net reaction: Ni(2+) +0.55D(+) + 2.55e(-) =  NiD(.55). Anode net reaction: NiD(.55)  = Ni(2+) +0.55D(+) -2.55(e-). Many extra electrons will no doubt be needed to build up adsorbed D during the cathode half-cycle; they will be recovered during the anode half-cycle. This should enable long-term operation under steady condition while requiring only a very small inventory of active materials. We will probably cycle the reaction at about 10 Hz while providing sufficient current density to deposit a layer of about 50 to 300 nanometers. Since anode and cathode overpotentials are seldom equal, the cycles will be current-controlled. The current  will be reversed rapidly enough to prevent D2 from bubbling off the cathode and O2 from bubbling off the anode. Cyclic  voltammetry (CV) measurements under conditions similar to ours indicate that H2 and O2 bubbling can be inhibited above about 2 Hz. We will use CV to tune our reaction. (Note that the common electric humidifier generates steam by electrolyzing water at 60 Hz and 120 V without evolving either hydrogen or oxygen.) For good electrical conductivity, the electrodes will be copper, covered with a thin film of pure nickel to facilitate an equal startup from either polarity state. (Which came first, the anode or the cathode?)
- Preliminary calculations for the reactor and the reaction, which will comprise a cage of 6 pairs of nickel-plated copper wire electrodes suspended in molten LiCl in a closed-bottom alumina tube, will be committed to this repository as "Molten Salt Fusion.xls"
- Because nickel forms SAVs at lower hydrogen concentrations than palladium, we will use it for our first experiment. Our experiment has a low inventory of active materials, so there is little cost barrier to palladium, and we will also try it.
- We are hoping to see hundreds of watts of excess heat!
