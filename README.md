Fused Salt Fusion
- Hello, I'm Howard Tracy Hall, Jr, @hthalljr. I go by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father and from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- in May 2022, at the age of 76, I came out of retirement to rejoin Hall Labs for this project, which I called "Very Cold Fusion." It was based on a hunch that cold fusion might be associated with superconductivity and that low temperature might enhance that effect. My intent was to extract fusion energy directly as microwaves in a resonant cavity operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures. After 7 months of study, I failed to find sufficient justification for the idea and decided to focus instead on incremental improvements to the work of others. 
- Hall Labs is an evergreen incubator founded in 1955 by H. Tracy Hall, Sr. Its current CEO is my brother, David R. Hall. Hall Labs is funding the project and is providing facilities, project management, and the expertise of its employees; I am donating my ideas and time.
- Our project is motivated by humanitarian considerations and is committed in its entirely to the public domain. Anything we discover is free to all, with no secrecy and no patents. (How can you patent fire?) We publish all our concepts, plans, and results on the Internet, regardless of success or failure. (Let's just call those first 7 months a "learning experience.") 
- GitHub is our primary open-source repository: new commits to Github are announced in that well-known scientific forum, Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tracy-Hall-Jr/578136106/
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts on their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your improvements to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your improvements are patentable, go for it! Do be aware that, at least in the USA, the patent office regards "cold fusion" with the same contempt as "perpetual motion," and it might insist on a working model.
- Not long after the first cold fusion announcement (Fleischmann & Pons 1989), Szpak & Mosier-Boss improved upon their work with a "codeposition" experiment (Szpak & Mosier-Boss 1991). Szpak reasoned that the long incubation time in the F-P experiment must have been due to slow diffusion in palladium, so under conditions similar to F-P, they deposited deuterium simultaneously with palladium. The deuterium was instantly included in the palladium at high concentration, requiring little if any diffusion. Rather than waiting weeks to observe excess heat, Szpak observed it promptly.
- Many experiments demonstrate that the principle nuclear ash is Helium 4, in quantities commensurate with the observed excess heat (Miles 2003). Since Helium has very low diffusion in palladium, these experiments indicate that the nuclear-active site must be at or near the surface .
- Some explanations of the F-P affect identify the nuclear-active site as a vacancy phase in Pd that is stabilized by deuterium (Letts & Hagelstein 2012, Staker 2019). Super-abundant vacancies (SAVs) were discovered in 1993 by Yu Fukai and coworkers, who forced hydrogen into nickel, palladium, and other metals at 5GPa (50 kbar) at 700 to 800 C (Fukai & ÅŒkuma 1993). They encapsulated their sample in salt, which is an excellent pressure transmitting medium and is impervious to hydrogen. (For the same reason, much oil and gas is found under a cap of salt). Vacancy concentrations in metals, even near their melting points, are usually less than about 0.1 atomic %, but Fukai observed astonishing concentrations of up to 30%! Each vacancy was stabilized by bonding to 6 adjacent hydrogen atoms. Significant for our experiment, the vacancies persisted at atmospheric pressure up to about 800 C. Fukai's discovery upset the received understanding of metal-hydrogen systems by demonstrating that SAVs are the most thermodynamically stable phase, and that most previously-known phases are actually metastable relative to SAVs. Fukai went on to observe hydrogen-stabilized vacancancies that had persisted for decades in electrodeposited copper and nickel (Fukai et al. 2003).
- Interestingly, Fukai employed a cubic x-ray press and measured the pressure with Dan Decker's PVT equation of state for sodium chloride. My father invented the multi-anvil press (Hall 1957). Later he and Dean Barnett adapted the tetrahedral press for in-situ x-ray diffraction, and used it to confirm Decker's scale (Jeffrey et al. 1966). That elegant machine is now on display at Hall Labs.
- Letts & Hagelstein suggest that Fleischmann and Pons had, in fact, unknowingly created conditions for formation of SAVs, and argue that the nuclear activity must had occurred primarily in the outer 100-300 nanometers of the palladium cathode. They provide an estimation of the H/metal ratio needed for various concentrations of SAVs, at temperatures from 0 to 1000K. For 25% SAVs in nickel, the ratio decreases from 0.7 at 0K to 0.53 at 1000K. For 25% SAVs in palladium, it decreases from 1.0 at 0K to 0.8 at 1000K. They improved upon the Szpak protocol by reducing the Pd(+2) concentration 40-fold while increasing D(+) activity, thereby further promoting SAVs. Their experiment ran at 50C (323K), with a D/Pd ratio of about 0.95 and an estimated SAV concentration of 25%. Our experiment will run at about 650C (923K), with a D/Ni ratio of about 0.55 and a SAV concentration of about 25%.
- Most cold fusion experiments to date have been in aqueous systems, with temperatures below the boiling of water (100 C). Carnot's theorem states that the efficiency of any heat engine is limited to the ratio (T1-T2)/T1, where T1 is the input temperature and T2 is the output temperature, in Kelvin. Thus the efficiency of a heat engine with 100 C (373 K) input and 25 C (298 K) output is limited to (373-298)/373, or about 20%. Modern thermal power plants generate steam at about 650 C (923 K) and condense it at 25 C (298K), for a maximum efficiency of about (923-298)/923, or about 68%.
- We propose two incremental improvements to existing methods:
- **First, Run hot!**
- We will conduct the reaction in molten lithium chloride (LiCl) at about 650C, in the same temperature range as thermal power plants. The nickel source will be nickel oxide (NiO), which reacts with 2LiCl to produce, in solution, nickel chloride (NiCl2) and lithium oxide (Li2O) (Horvath & Simpson 2018). In the electrolytic reduction of spent uranium oxide fuel in molten LiCl, a small percent of Li2O, of the order of 1 wt %, is added to lower the reduction potential of uranium oxide and to assure that the gas produced at the anode will be oxygen instead of chlorine (Williams 2021). The solubility limit of Li20 in LiCl at 650C is 8.7 wt % (Hur et al 2010). The deuterium source will be D2O, introduced as vapor carried in argon. D2O will react with 2LiCl to form, in solution, 2DCl and additional Li2O. A group at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China have added H2O to molten LiCl as vapor in a stream of argon, reducing H(+) to H2 gas, and using the H2 to reduce a variety of metal oxides to metal. In one noteworthy experiment, they reduced cobalt oxide to the metal in its high temperature fcc phase, which remained stable at room temperature. They believe that the stability arose from "hydrogen doping" at .113 wt% (Qiao et al. 2020). That is 6.2 atomic %, which can only be explained as super-abundant vacancies! One wonders, had they used D2O instead of H2O, if they would have needed to turn the furnace power down. We intend to find out!
- **Second, Run in circles!**
- We propose cyclic codeposition and destruction of a very thin film of nickel or palladium having about 25% of deuterium-stabilized SAVs. This should enable long-term steady-state operation while requiring only a small inventory of metal and deuterium. Prior protocols for codeposition of palladium with deuterium result in the burial of these expensive materials in the growing deposit: in one extended experiment, reported by Mosier-Boss to Letts & Hagelstein, the palladium-deuterium deposit on a thin square copper cathode grew to a sphere one inch in diameter! Since the nuclear activity occurs at or near the surface, why not cyclically disintigrate and replace that surface? We hope to accomplish this using alternating current (AC) codeposition between two identical electrodes, A and B, which on successive half-cycles serve either as as cathode (reduction and deposition) or anode (oxidation and dissolution). In the first half-cycle, a thin layer of metal in a nuclear-active SAV state is laid down on electrode A, while the layer that had been deposited previously on electrode B is simultaneously disintigrated. In the second half-cycle, an active layer is laid down on electrode B while the layer on electrode A is disintigrated. The frequency and current profile will be adjusted so that the dissolution products (D2 gas and Ni(2+) or Pd(2+)) do not have time to escape the surface of the electrode and can be fully be re-deposited in the next half-cycle. A reprentative net cathode reaction might be Ni(2+) +2.55D(+) + 4.55e(-) = NiD(.55) +2D (adsorbed). The corresponding net anode reaction would then be NiD(.55) +2D (adsorbed) = Ni(2+) + 1.275 D2 (gas) -4.55(e-). (In order to drive D into the developing lattice, a high excess activity of D must be provided  at the surface). We will probably run at about 10 Hz while providing sufficient current density to deposit a layer of about 50 to 300 nanometers. We will use cyclic voltammetry (CV) to tune the reaction: CV measurements under conditions similar to ours indicate that loss of H2 and O2 bubbles can be prevented above about 2 Hz (Gese 2015, pp 93-94). Note also that the familiar electric humidifier generates steam by electrolyzing water at 60 Hz and 120 V without evolving hydrogen or oxygen. For good electrical conductivity, the electrodes will be copper, covered with a thin layer of pure nickel to facilitate an equal startup from either polarity state. (Which came first, the anode or the cathode?)
- Preliminary designs and calculations for the reactor and the reaction will be committed to this repository as "Fused Salt Fusion.xls." It will comprise a cage of 6 pairs of nickel-plated copper wire electrodes with a total area of about 60 sq cm, immersed in 10 cm of molten LiCl in a closed-bottom alumina tube, with a molybdenum pseudo-reference electrode, a thermocouple, and a central immersion heater for calorimetry.
- Because nickel forms SAVs at lower hydrogen concentrations than palladium and is more abundant and less expensive than Pd, we will use it for our first experiment. After that we will try palladium, and perhaps cobalt and a variety of other elements and alloys.
- Our goal is to to produce hundreds of watts of excess heat!
