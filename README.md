"Very Cold Fusion" project.
- Hello, I'm @hthalljr, Howard Tracy Hall, Jr. I go by Tracy, or by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father or from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- At age 76, I'm coming out of retirement to lead an open-source project at Hall Labs which we call "Very Cold Fusion."
- Hall Labs is an incubator founded by my brother, David R. Hall. David is funding the project through his foundation, and I'm donating my time.
- Every aspect of the Very Cold Fusion project is open source and is committed to the public domain. It is free to all. No secrecy. No IP. We will publish ideas, experiments, successes & failures in real time on the Internet.
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts on their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your fork to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your fork is patentable, go for it! Do disclose to your country's patent office that which has already been placed in the public domain, and also remember that, at least in the USA, the patent office classifies cold fusion with perpetual motion and requires a working model.
- After a review of the large literature published in the 33 years since the announcement by Fleischmann and Pons on March 23, 1989, I have a vague notion that the phenomenon of "anomalous heat" / aka "cold fusion" / aka "low energy nuclear reactions" is associated with isolated tiny pockets of superconductivity.
- If this notion is correct, it means that man has been observing high temperature superconductivity, at temperatures as high as several hundred C, for 33 years!
- This will probably only happen at very low temperatures, hence "Very Cold Fusion."
- To date the theories that attempt to explain the "anomalous heat" that has been observed in thousands of cold fusion experiments seem to be grasping at straws: we just don't fully understand what is going on. But the arm waving explanations that appeal most to me suggest that cold fusion is a collective phenomenon. There appears to be some distributed state of deuterium that enables two deuterium atoms, which are bosons, to be magically chosen, at random, from a collective state involving hundreds or thousands, to fuse into a single helium-4 atom via baby steps. Each step appears to release its energy to an optical phonon in the lattice at a frequency in the terahertz range -- as heat.
- Realizing that superconductivity is also a collective phenomenon, our efforts will focus on finding a material that can be highy loaded with deuterium and is also a bulk superconductor -- or at least is able to sustain a continuous network of filamentary superconducting centers that can short circuit the bulk material.
- We will then form a resonant microwave cavity out of the new material, cool it down to an appropriate temperature, wave a magic wand, and very gently lower the distributed deuterium state via baby-baby steps to the ground state of helium 4, extracting the fusion energy as gigahertz microwaves -- as electricity!
