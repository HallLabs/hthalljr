Project: Fused Salt Fusion [this readme.md is still a work in progress]
- Hello, I'm Howard Tracy Hall, Jr, @hthalljr. I go by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father and from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- in May 2022, at the age of 76, I came out of retirement to rejoin Hall Labs for this project, which I called "Very Cold Fusion." It was based on a notion that cold fusion might be associated with superconductivity and that low temperature might enhance that effect. My intent was to extract fusion energy directly as microwaves in a resonant cavity operating at liquid nitrogen temperature. After 7 months of study, I failed to find sufficient justification for the idea and decided to focus instead on incremental improvements to the discoveries of others. 
- Hall Labs is an evergreen incubator founded in 1955 by H. Tracy Hall, Sr. Its current CEO is my brother, David R. Hall. Hall Labs is funding the project and is providing facilities, project management, and the expertise of its staff; I am donating my ideas and my time.
- Our project is motivated by humanitarian considerations and is committed in its entirety to the public domain. Anything we discover is free to all, with no secrecy and no patents. (How can you patent fire?) We publish all our concepts, plans, and results on the Internet, regardless of success or failure. (Let's just call my first 7 months a "learning experience.") 
- GitHub is our primary open-source repository: new commits to Github are announced in that well-known scientific forum, Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tracy-Hall-Jr/578136106/
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts upon their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your improvements to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your improvements are patentable, go for it! Do be aware that, at least in the USA, the patent office regards cold fusion with the same distain as perpetual motion and might insist on a working model.
- Not long after the first cold fusion announcement (Fleischmann and Pons 1989), Szpak and Mosier-Boss improved upon their work with a codeposition experiment (Szpak and Mosier-Boss 1991). They reasoned that the long incubation time in the F-P experiment must have been due to slow diffusion in palladium, so under conditions similar to F-P, they deposited deuterium simultaneously with palladium. The deuterium was instantly included in the palladium at high concentration, requiring little if any diffusion. Rather than waiting weeks to observe excess heat, Szpak and Mosier-Boss observed it promptly.
- Many experiments demonstrate that the principle nuclear ash in cold fusion is Helium 4, in quantities commensurate with the observed excess heat (Miles 2003). Since the diffusion of helium in palladium is extremely slow, these experiments indicate that the nuclear-active site must be at or near the surface .
- Some have suggested that the nuclear-activity in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment might be a vacancy phase in palladium that is stabilized by deuterium (Letts and Hagelstein 2012, Staker 2019). Super-abundant vacancies (SAVs) were discovered in 1993 by Yuh Fukai and Nobuyuki Ōkuma, who forced hydrogen into nickel, palladium, and other metals at 5GPa (50 kbar) and 700 to 800 C while monitoring the lattice parameters (Fukai & Ōkuma 1993). They encapsulated their sample in salt, which is an excellent pressure transmitting medium and is impervious to hydrogen. (For the same reasons, many oil and gas deposits are found under a trapping layer of salt). The concentration of vacancies in metals, even near their melting points, is usually lower than about 0.1 atomic %, but Fukai observed astonishing vacancy concentrations of up to 30%! Each vacancy was stabilized by interaction with up to 6 adjacent hydrogen atoms. Significant for our experiment, the vacancies persisted when the sample was removed from the press and reheated, at atmospheric pressure, up to about 800 C. Fukai's discovery upset the received understanding of metal-hydrogen systems by demonstrating that SAVs are, in fact, the most thermodynamically stable phase, and that most previously-known phases are actually metastable relative to them. Fukai also suggested that SAVs could be created during electroplating of metals and found hydrogen-stabilized vacancies in samples of electrolytic copper and nickel which  had persisted for decades (Fukai et al. 2003).
- Interestingly, Fukai employed a cubic x-ray press and calibrated the pressure with Dan Decker's PVT equation of state for sodium chloride. My father invented the multi-anvil press (Hall 1958). Later he and Dean Barnett built a tetrahedral press for in-situ x-ray diffraction and used it to confirm Decker's scale (Jeffrey et al. 1966). That elegant machine is now on display at Hall Labs.
- Letts and Hagelstein suggest that Fleischmann and Pons had, in fact, unknowingly created conditions for formation of SAVs, and that the nuclear activity must have occurred primarily in the outer 100-300 nanometers of the palladium cathode. They provide an estimate of the H/metal ratio needed to facilitate various concentrations of SAVs, at temperatures from 0 to 1000 K. or 25% SAVs in nickel, the ratio decreases from 0.7 at 0 K to 0.53 at 1000 K. For 25% SAVs in palladium, the ratio decreases from 1.0 at 0 K to 0.8 at 1000 K. They improved upon the Szpak protocol by reducing the Pd(+2) concentration about 40-fold while increasing the activity of D(+), thereby further promoting SAVs. Their experiment ran at 50 C (323 K), with a D/Pd ratio of about 0.95 and an estimated SAV concentration of 25%. Our experiment will run at about 650 C (92 3K), with a D/Ni ratio of about 0.55 and similar SAV concentration.
- Most cold fusion experiments to date have been in aqueous systems, with temperatures below the boiling of water (100 C). Carnot's theorem states that the efficiency of any heat engine is limited to the ratio (T1-T2)/T1, where T1 is the input temperature and T2 is the output temperature, in Kelvin. Thus the efficiency of a heat engine with 100 C input (373 K) and 25 C output (298 K) is limited to (373-298)/373 or about 20%. Modern thermal power plants generate hight pressure steam at about 650C (923 K) and condense it at 25 C (298 K), for a maximum efficiency of (923-298)/923 or about 68%.
- We propose two improvements to existing protocols, the first incremental and the second revolutionary.
- **First, Run hot!**
- A group at the University of Hawaii (Liaw et al. 1991) were the first achieve cold fusion at thermodynamically interesting temperatures (370 C to 470 C). They dissolved lithium deuteride in a eutectic mixture of LiCl and KCl. In their experiment, the deuteriom was present in the molten salt as an anion, D(-), and was oxidized to atomic D at a Pd cathode, wherupon some of it entered the Pd lattice. The Li(+) cation was reduced at an aluminum cathode, where it reacted to form LiAl. (By contrast, in the Fleischmann-Pons experiment, the deuterium was in aqueous solution as a cation, D(+), and was reduced to atomic D at a Pd cathode, where some of it entered the Pd lattice.) Liaw et al. reported considerable excess heat in some experiments but found the results difficult to replicate. 
- We propose to run much hotter than this, at about 650 C, by using molten lithium chloride (LiCl). This is a dull red heat, in the same temperature range as thermal power plants. The nickel source will be solid nickel oxide (NiO), which reacts with 2LiCl to give the dissolved ions Ni(++), O(--), 2Li(+), and 2Cl(-) (Horvath and Simpson 2018). In the similar process for electrolytic reduction of spent uranium oxide fuel in molten LiCl, a small percent of Li2O, of the order of 1 wt %, is added to lower the reduction potential of uranium oxide and to assure that the gas produced at the anode will be oxygen instead of chlorine (Williams et al. 2021). The solubility limit of Li20 in LiCl at 650C is 8.7 wt % (Hur et al 2010). Our deuterium source will be D2O, introduced as vapor transported by argon. The D2O will react with 2LiCl to form the dissolved ions 2D(+), O(--), 2Li(+), and 2Cl(-), with the latter three ions adding to those already derived from the NiO. The applied voltage will be limited so that nickel metal, atomic deuterium, and atomic oxygen are produced in preference to molten lithium and Cl2 gas.
- The process for safely adding controlled amounts of H2O to molten LiCl via a stream of argon and electrolytically producing hydrogen and oxygen at relatively low voltages was developed by a group at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China (Qiao et al. 2020, p. 2232). The hydrogen is produced at a cathode consisiting of a metal oxide, which is reduced by H to metal; the oxygen bubbles off at a graphite anode. (At 650 C, oxidation of the graphite to carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide is slow). We will replace the H2O with D2O. In one noteworthy experiment, they reduced cobalt oxide to the metal in its high temperature fcc phase, which surprisingly remained stable when cooled to room temperature. They believe that the stability arose from "hydrogen doping" at 0.113 wt% . That is 6.2 atomic percent, leading me to I believe that they accidentally rediscovered super-abundant vacancies! They did not mention SAVs or Fukai's work, noting only that the high hydrogen concentration merited further investigation. If they had used D2O instead of H2O, would they have also rediscovered cold fusion? To keep the furnace temperature constant, would they have needed to turn the power down? We intend to find out!
- **Second, Run in circles!**
- The revolutionary part of our experiment will be to use alternating current (AC) electrolysis! If you are interested in accumulating an electrochemical product, it makes no sense to run an electrolytical cell with alternating current, because you're just running in circles. But if by running in circles you can produce abundant nuclear energy while consuming only the tiniest fraction of the reactants, then rapidly reversing a reaction between two identical electrodes actually makes sense. An extreme instance of one-way cold fusion was reported by Mosier-Boss to Letts and Hagelstein (2012, ref. 9, p. 54). In one of her experiments, the palladium-deuterium alloy that was codeposited onto a thin square copper cathode eventually grew to a sphere one inch in diameter, while the nuclear energy was being released only from a thin surface layer. The precious palladium could, of course, be recycled, but this is no way to run a power plant!
- Given that the nuclear activity occurs at or near the surface, why not just cyclically grow, disintigrate, and regrow that surface? This can be accomplished by rapidly switching the current between two identical electrodes, A and B, which on successive half-cycles serve either as as cathode (for simultanious reduction of Ni(++) and D(+) to NiD) or anode (oxidation back to dissolved NiO and D2O). In the first half-cycle, a thin layer of metal in a nuclear-active SAV state is laid down on electrode A, while the layer that had been deposited previously on electrode B is simultaneously disintigrated. In the second half-cycle, an active layer is laid down on electrode B while the layer on electrode A is disintigrated. The frequency and current will be adjusted so that the atomic deuterium and oxygen that are adsorbed do not have time to form gaseous D2 and O2 bubble large enough to escape, so that they can be reused in the next half-cycle.
- A representative net cathode reaction might be Ni(2+) +2.55D(+) + 4.55 e(-) = NiD(.55)(solid) + 2D (adsorbed). (In order to drive deuterium into the developing lattice, excess activity must be provided at the surface: 2 adsorbed D per .55 interatomic D is just a guess. The deuterium activity might not need to be very high: Qiao et al. operated at only 1 volt, just sufficient to reduce H(+) to H2.) The corresponding net anode reaction would then be NiD(.55) +2 D (adsorbed) = Ni(2+) + 2.55 D(+) - 4.55 e(-). Note that deuterium and nickel are regenerated. We will probably "run in circles" at about 3 Hz while providing sufficient current density to deposit a SAV layer of about 50 to 300 nanometers. We will use cyclic voltammetry (CV) to identify the necessary oxidation and reduction potentials and to optimize the frequency and voltage swing. CV measurements under conditions similar to ours indicate that loss of H2 and O2 bubbles can be prevented at frequencies above about 2 Hz (Gese 2015, pp 93-94). (Note that the familiar immersion humidifier generates steam by AC electrolysis of water at 60 Hz and 120 V without evolving hydrogen or oxygen.) 
- Calculations for the experiment are committed to this repository as a native Libre Office spreadsheet "Fused Salt Fusion.ods," together with a conversion to Microsoft .xls format. The "cookbook" for the experiment will be "Fused Salt Fusion protocol.pdf." The reactor will comprise a cage of 6 pairs of 12 AWG pure nickel electrodes, 2.05 mm in diameter, immersed to a depth of 10 cm of molten LiCl in a closed-bottom alumina tube. The total immersed surface area is 77 sq cc. In any half-cycle, half that area will be active as a cathode; the other as an anode. A molybdenum wire will serve as a pseudo-reference electrode for CV measurements, together with leads to the bottom end of two adjacent electrodes to provide accurate potentials. A thermocouple and a central immersion heater will facilitate calorimetry. A Kepco BOP6-125 MG 4-quadrant power supply will provide up to 125 amperes of electrolysis current, with arbitrary waveforms programmable from 0 to 800 Hz .
- We chose nickel instead of palladium for our first experiment because it forms SAVs at lower hydrogen concentrations than palladium and is much less expensive. Depending on results, we we will also try palladium, and perhaps also cobalt and a variety of other transition elements and alloys.
- Our goal is to provide thermodynamically useful heat in a self-sufficient, stand-alone device.
