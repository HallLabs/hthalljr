Fused Salt Fusion
- Hello, I'm Howard Tracy Hall, Jr, @hthalljr. I go by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father and from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- in May 2022, at the age of 76, I came out of retirement to rejoin Hall Labs for this project, which I called "Very Cold Fusion." It was based on a notion that cold fusion might be associated with superconductivity and that low temperature might enhance that effect. My intent was to extract fusion energy directly as microwaves in a resonant cavity operating at liquid nitrogen temperature. After 7 months of study, I failed to find sufficient justification for the idea and decided to focus instead on incremental improvements to the discoveries of others. 
- Hall Labs is an evergreen incubator founded in 1955 by H. Tracy Hall, Sr. Its current CEO is my brother, David R. Hall. Hall Labs is funding the project and is providing facilities, project management, and the expertise of its employees; I am donating my ideas and time.
- Our project is motivated by humanitarian considerations and is committed in its entirety to the public domain. Anything we discover is free to all, with no secrecy and no patents. (How can you patent fire?) We publish all our concepts, plans, and results on the Internet, regardless of success or failure. (Let's just call those first 7 months a "learning experience.") 
- GitHub is our primary open-source repository: new commits to Github are announced in that well-known scientific forum, Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tracy-Hall-Jr/578136106/
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts upon their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your improvements to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your improvements are patentable, go for it! Do be aware that, at least in the USA, the patent office regards cold fusion with the same distain as perpetual motion and might insist on a working model.
- Not long after the first cold fusion announcement (Fleischmann and Pons 1989), Szpak and Mosier-Boss improved upon their work with a codeposition experiment (Szpak and Mosier-Boss 1991). They reasoned that the long incubation time in the F-P experiment must have been due to slow diffusion in palladium, so under conditions similar to F-P, they deposited deuterium simultaneously with palladium. The deuterium was instantly included in the palladium at high concentration, requiring little if any diffusion. Rather than waiting weeks to observe excess heat, Szpak and Mosier-Boss observed it promptly.
- Many experiments demonstrate that the principle nuclear ash in cold fusion is Helium 4, in quantities commensurate with the observed excess heat (Miles 2003). Since Helium has very low diffusion in palladium, these experiments indicate that the nuclear-active site must be at or near the surface .
- Some explanations of the Fleischmann-Pons affect identify the nuclear-active site as a vacancy phase in Pd that is stabilized by deuterium (Letts and Hagelstein 2012, Staker 2019). Super-abundant vacancies (SAVs) were discovered in 1993 by Yuh Fukai and Nobuyuki Ōkuma, who forced hydrogen into nickel, palladium, and other metals at 5GPa (50 kbar) at 700 to 800 C while monitoring the lattice parameters (Fukai & Ōkuma 1993). They encapsulated their sample in salt, which is an excellent pressure transmitting medium and is impervious to hydrogen. (For the same reasons, many oil and gas deposits are found under a trapping layer of salt). Vacancy concentrations in metals, even near their melting points, are usually less than about 0.1 atomic %, but Fukai observed astonishing concentrations of up to 30%! Each vacancy was stabilized by bonding to 6 adjacent hydrogen atoms. Significant for our experiment, the vacancies persisted at atmospheric pressure up to about 800 C. Fukai's discovery upset the received understanding of metal-hydrogen systems by demonstrating that SAVs are the most thermodynamically stable phase, and that most previously-known phases are actually metastable relative to SAVs. Fukai and coworkers later found SAVs that had persisted for decades in commercial samples of electrodeposited copper and nickel (Fukai et al. 2003).
- Interestingly, Fukai employed a cubic x-ray press and measured the pressure with Dan Decker's PVT equation of state for sodium chloride. My father invented the multi-anvil press (Hall 1958). Later he and Dean Barnett built a tetrahedral press for in-situ x-ray diffraction and used it to confirm Decker's scale (Jeffrey et al. 1966). That elegant machine is now on display at Hall Labs.
- Letts and Hagelstein suggest that Fleischmann and Pons had, in fact, unknowingly created conditions for formation of SAVs, and they argue that the nuclear activity must have occurred primarily in the outer 100-300 nanometers of the palladium cathode. They provide an estimate of the H/metal ratio needed for various concentrations of SAVs, at temperatures from 0 to 1000K. For 25% SAVs in nickel, the ratio decreases from 0.7 at 0K to 0.53 at 1000K. For 25% SAVs in palladium, it decreases from 1.0 at 0K to 0.8 at 1000K. They improved upon the Szpak protocol by reducing the Pd(+2) concentration 40-fold while increasing D(+) activity, thereby further promoting SAVs. Their experiment ran at 50C (323K), with a D/Pd ratio of about 0.95 and an estimated SAV concentration of 25%. Our experiment will run at about 650C (923K), with a D/Ni ratio of about 0.55 and similar SAV concentration.
- Most cold fusion experiments to date have been in aqueous systems, with temperatures below the boiling of water (100 C). Carnot's theorem states that the efficiency of any heat engine is limited to the ratio (T1-T2)/T1, where T1 is the input temperature and T2 is the output temperature, in Kelvin. Thus the efficiency of a heat engine with 100C input (373K) and 25C output (298K) is limited to (373-298)/373 or about 20%. Modern thermal power plants generate steam at about 650C (923K) and condense it at 25C (298K), for a maximum efficiency of (923-298)/923 or about 68%.
- We propose two incremental improvements to existing methods:
- **First, Run hot!**
- We will conduct the reaction in molten lithium chloride (LiCl) at about 650C, in the same temperature range as thermal power plants. The nickel source will be nickel oxide (NiO), which reacts with 2LiCl to produce, in solution, nickel chloride, Ni(2+) + 2 Cl(-), and lithium oxide, 2 Li(+) + O(-2) (Horvath and Simpson 2018). In the electrolytic reduction of spent uranium oxide fuel in molten LiCl, a small percent of Li2O, of the order of 1 wt %, is added to lower the reduction potential of uranium oxide and to assure that the gas produced at the anode will be oxygen instead of chlorine (Williams et al. 2021). The solubility limit of Li20 in LiCl at 650C is 8.7 wt % (Hur et al 2010). The deuterium source will be D2O, introduced as vapor carried in argon. D2O will react with LiCl to form D(+), Cl(-) and additional Li(+) and O(2-).  
- A group at Northeastern University in Shenyang, China have been adding H2O to molten LiCl as vapor in a stream of argon, producing H2 gas to reduce a variety of metal oxides to metal at the cathode while forming CO2 gas at a graphite anode. In one noteworthy experiment, they reduced cobalt oxide to the metal in its high temperature fcc phase, which remained stable at room temperature. They believe that the stability arose from "hydrogen doping" at 0.113 wt% (Qiao et al. 2020, p. 2232). That is 6.2 atomic %: I believe that they rediscovered super-abundant vacancies! They did not appear to have known about Fukai's work, noting only that the high hydrogen concentration merited further investigation. If they had used D2O instead of H2O, would they have also rediscovered cold fusion? To keep the furnace temperature constant, would they have needed to turn the power down? We intend to find out!
- **Second, Run in circles!**
- We propose cyclic codeposition and destruction of a very thin film of nickel having about 25% of deuterium-stabilized SAVs. This should enable long-term steady-state operation while requiring only a small inventory of metal and deuterium. Prior protocols for codeposition of palladium with deuterium result in the burial of these expensive materials in the growing deposit: in one extended experiment, reported by Mosier-Boss to Letts and Hagelstein (2012, ref. 9, p. 54), the palladium-deuterium deposit on a thin square copper cathode grew to a sphere one inch in diameter! 
- Since the nuclear activity occurs at or near the surface, why not cyclically disintigrate and replace that surface? We hope to accomplish this using alternating current (AC) codeposition between two identical electrodes, A and B, which on successive half-cycles serve either as as cathode (reduction and deposition) or anode (oxidation and dissolution). In the first half-cycle, a thin layer of metal in a nuclear-active SAV state is laid down on electrode A, while the layer that had been deposited previously on electrode B is simultaneously disintigrated. In the second half-cycle, an active layer is laid down on electrode B while the layer on electrode A is disintigrated. The frequency and current profile will be adjusted so that the dissolution products (D2 gas and Ni(2+) do not have time to escape the surface of the electrode and can be fully be re-deposited in the next half-cycle. 
- A representative net cathode reaction might be Ni(2+) +2.55 D(+) + 4.55 e(-) = NiD(.55)(solid) + 2 D (adsorbed). (In order to drive deuterium into the developing lattice, excess activity must be provided at the surface. The deuterium activity might not need to be very high: Qiao et al. operated at only 1 volt, just sufficient to reduce H(+) to H2.) The corresponding net anode reaction would then be NiD(.55) +2 D (adsorbed) = Ni(2+) + 2.55 D(+) - 4.55 e(-). Note that deuterium and nickel are regenerated. We will probably "run in circles" at about 10 Hz while providing sufficient current density to deposit a SAV layer of about 50 to 300 nanometers. We will use cyclic voltammetry (CV) to tune the reaction: CV measurements under conditions similar to ours indicate that loss of H2 and O2 bubbles can be prevented at frequencies above about 2 Hz (Gese 2015, pp 93-94). Note also that the familiar immersion humidifier generates steam by AC electrolysis of water at 60 Hz and 120 V without evolving hydrogen or oxygen. For good electrical conductivity, our electrodes will be copper, covered with a thin layer of pure nickel to facilitate an equal startup condition from either polarity.
- Preliminary calculations for the reactor will be committed to this repository as "Fused Salt Fusion.xls." It will comprise a cage of 6 pairs of 14 AWG nickel-plated copper wire electrodes, 1.63 mm in diameter, with a total area of about 60 sq cm, immersed in 10 cm of molten LiCl in a closed-bottom alumina tube. A molybdenum wire will serve as a pseudo-reference electrode for CV measurements, and a thermocouple and a central immersion heater will facilitate calorimetry. A Kepco BOP6-125 MG 4-quadrant power supply will provide up to 125 amperes of electrolysis current, with arbitrary waveforms programmable from 0 to 800 Hz .
- Because nickel forms SAVs at lower hydrogen concentrations than palladium and is much less expensive than Pd, we will use it for our first experiment. After that we will try palladium, and perhaps also cobalt and a variety of other elements and alloys.
- Our goal is to provide thermodynamically useful heat in a self-sufficient, stand-alone device.
