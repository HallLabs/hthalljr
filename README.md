Project: Molten Salt Fusion
- Hello, I'm Howard Tracy Hall, Jr, @hthalljr. I go by Tracy Jr to distinguish myself from my late father and from my son and colleague, Huntington Tracy Hall.
- in May of 2022, at the age of 76, I came out of retirement to pursue this project at Hall Labs, which I called "Very Cold Fusion." It was based on a hunch that cold fusion might be associated with superconductivity and that low temperature might enhance that effect. My intent was to extract fusion energy directly as microwaves in a resonant cavity operating at liquid nitrogen temperatures. After 7 months of intensive re-education and searching in the literature, I failed to find much support for the idea and decided to redirect my efforts to seeking more rational, modest improvements to the work of others. 
- Hall Labs is an evergreen incubator founded in 1955 by H. Tracy Hall, Sr. Its current CEO is my brother, David R. Hall, who is semi-retired. Hall Labs is funding the project and providing facilities and the support of its employees; I am donating my ideas and time.
- Our project is open-source and committed in its entirety to the public domain. Anything we discover is free to all, with no secrecy and no patents. (How do you patent fire?) We publish all our concepts, plans, and results on the Internet, regardless of success or failure. (Let's just call my first 7 months a learning experience.) 
- GitHub is our primary repository; new commits to Github are announced on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/people/Tracy-Hall-Jr/578136106/
- We agree with Adam Smith that when everyone acts on their own enlightened self interest, society as a whole will benefit. So fork this project! If your interests are humanitarian, dedicate your improvements to the public domain. If your interests are commercial and you believe your improvements are patentable, go for it! Do be aware that, at least in the USA, the patent office regards cold fusion with the same contempt as it regards perpetual motion, and it might insist on a working model.
- Within a year of the announcement by Martin Fleischmann & Stanley Pons (March 23, 1989), Stan Szpak & Pamela Mosier-Boss improved upon their result with a "codeposition" experiment. Szpak reasoned that the long incubation time in the F-P experiment must have been due to slow diffusion in palladium, so under conditions similar to F-P, they deposited deuterium simultaneously with palladium. The deuterium was instantly included in the palladium at high concentration, requiring little if any diffusion. Rather than waiting weeks to observe excess heat, Szpak & Mosier-Boss observed it promptly.
- In 2003, Melvin Miles reviewed many experiments that pointed to the principle nuclear "ash" as Helium 4 and found it in quantities commensurate with the observed heat. Since Helium has very low diffusion in palladium, these experiments indicated that the nuclear-active site must be near the surface.
- Some current explanations of the F-P affect identify the nuclear-active site as a vacancy phase in Pd that is stabilized by deuterium. Super-abundant vacancies (SAVs) were discovered in 1993 by Yu Fukai and coworkers, who forced hydrogen into nickel, palladium, and other metals at 5GPa (50 kbar) at 700 to 800 C. They encapsulated their sample in salt, which is an excellent pressure transmitting medium and is impervious to hydrogen. (For the same reason, much oil and gas is found under salt). Vacancy concentrations in metals, even near their melting points, are usually less than about 0.1%, but Fukai observed an astonishing vacancy concentration of up to 30%! Each vacancy was stabilized by bonding to 6 adjacent hydrogen atoms. Significantly for our experiment, the vacancies persisted at atmospheric pressure up to about 800 C. Fukai upset the received understanding of metal-hydrogen systems with the discovery, that in at least some systems, SAVs are, in fact, the most thermodynamically stable phase, and that most previously-known phases are, in fact, metastable relative to SAVs. SAVs had never been seen under equilibrium conditions because of very low diffusion rate of vacancies and the difficulty of obtaining high concentrations of hydrogen. Fukai went on to observe hydrogen-stabilized vacancancies that had persisted for decades in electrodeposited copper and nickel.
- Interestingly, Fukai employed a cubic x-ray press and calibrated his pressure with Dan Decker's PVT equation of state for sodium chloride. My father invented the tetrahedral and cubic presses in 1958, and later, with Decker and Dean Barnett, adapted the tetrahedral press for in-situ x-ray diffraction. Decker's scale is still a primary pressure standard, and their elegant tetrahedral x-ray press is still on display at Hall Labs.
- By 2012, Dennis Letts & Peter Hagelstein were suggesting that the Fleiscmann-Pons effect had, in fact, been facilitated by the accidental creation of SAVs. They improved upon the experiment of Szpak and Mosier-Boss to enhance SAV creation by reducing Pd(+2) concentration (activity) while increasing D(+) activity.
- Most cold fusion experiments to date have been in aqueous systems, with temperatures below the boiling of water (100 C). Sadie Carnot's theorem (1824) states that the efficiency of any heat engine to produce useful work is limited by the ratio of the difference between input and output temperature to the absolute input temperature. So the efficiency of a heat engine having 100 C (373 K) input and 25 C (298 K) output is limited to 75/373, or about 20%. Modern thermal power plants generate steam at about 650 C (923 K) and condense it at 25 C (298K), for a maximum efficiency of about 625/923, or about 68%.
- We propose two improvements to existing cold fusion technology that seem attainable:
- First, why not run hot?
- We will conduct the reaction in molten lithium chloride (LiCl) at about 650C, in the same temperature range as a thermal power plant. The nickel source will be nickel oxide (NiO), which reacts with LiCl to produce nickel chloride (NiCl) and lithium oxide (Li2O), both in solution. In the electrolytic reduction of spent uranium oxide fuel in molten LiCl, a small percent of LiO, up to 1 weight %, is added to lower the reduction potential of uranium oxide and to assure that the gas produced at the anode will be oxygen instead of chlorine. In our experiment, the Li2O generated from NiO will have the same effect. The deuterium source will be D2O (heavy water) introduced as vapor carried in argon. Note that D2O activity can be freeely increased, while Ni activity is limited, thereby favoring SAV formation, as per Letts and Hagelstein. The electrolysis will be reversed rapidly enough to prevent D2 from bubbling off the cathode and O2 from bubbling off the anode. (The literature suggests that under our conditions in molten LiCl, H2 and O2 bubbling can be inhibited beginning at about 2 Hz. Note also that the common electric humidifier generates steam by electrolyzing water at 60 Hz without evolving either hydrogen or oxygen.)
- Second, why waste palladium or deuterium?
- We propose cyclic codeposition and destruction of a very thin film of metal hydride while inducing SAVs. The protocols for codeposition of palladium with deuterium bury substantial quantities of these expensive materials in the growing deposit. (In one extended experiment, the palladium deposit reached an inch in diameter.) Since the nuclear activity is at or near the surface, why use the active materials for only a fraction of a second and then bury them? Instead of unidirectional codeposition, we propose conducting alternating current (AC) codeposition between two identical electrodes, A and B, which rapidly exchange roles between cathode and anode. In the first half-cycle, a thin layer of paladium deuteride in the nuclear-active SAV state is laid down on electrode A, while the layer that had been deposited previously on electrode B is simultaneously disintigrated. In the second half-cycle, an active layer is laid down on electrode B while the layer on electrode A is disintigrated. The dissolution products remain close to their respective electrodes in solution or suspension, to be re-deposited  in the next half-cycle. This should enable long-term operation under steady condition while requiring only a very small inventory of active materials. We will probably cycle the reaction at about 10 Hz while providing sufficient current density to deposit a layer of about 100 unit cells. Since anode and cathode overpotentials are seldom equal, the cycles will be current-controlled. For good electrical conductivity, the electrodes will be copper, covered with a thin film of pure nickel to facilitate equal startup from either polarity state. (Otherwise, which would come first, the nuclear chicken, or the scrambled egg?)
- Because nickel is abundant and inexpensive and is also known to form SAVs, our first experiments will be with nickel. But since very little material is needed, we will also try palladium. We are hoping to see excess heat on the order of hundreds of watts.
- Preliminary calculations for the reactor and the reaction, which will take place in a cage of 6 pairs of nickel-plated copper wire electrodes suspended in molten LiCl in a closed-bottom alumina tube, will be committed to this repository as "Cyclic Codep Calcs.xls"
